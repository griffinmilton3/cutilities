To use, pick an individual header or use cutilities.h to pull all the headers in. 

## Coding standard ##
Take a look at [Michael Barr's coding standard](https://barrgroup.com/sites/default/files/barr_c_coding_standard_2018.pdf) which outlines how to make code that is easier to comprehend. The following table is used for this library and is an expantion of the aforementioned standard.
